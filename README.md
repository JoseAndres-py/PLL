# Phase Locked Loop

For phase Locked Loop (PLL) algorithms, is proposed methodology is based on voltage representation in a three coordinates: natural (abc), stationary (\boldmath $\alpha \beta$) and rotating coordinates (dq), in order to meet the requirements for grid synchronization necessary that the control of Distributed Power Generation Systems (DPGS). The grid synchronization algorithms perform a essential role for Distributed Power Generation Systems therefore, discusses one of the synchronization strategies that use Phase Locked Loop (PLL) and its diverse types for synchronization of the electric grid.

Single Phase Phase Locked Loop
==========
In this assignment, you will be required to explore, segment, and cluster the neighborhoods in the city of Toronto. However, unlike New York, the neighborhood data is not readily available on the internet. What is interesting about the field of data science is that each project can be challenging in its unique way, so you need to learn to be agile and refine the skill to learn new libraries and tools quickly depending on the project.

For the Toronto neighborhood data, a Wikipedia page exists that has all the information we need to explore and cluster the neighborhoods in Toronto. You will be required to scrape the Wikipedia page and wrangle the data, clean it, and then read it into a pandas dataframe so that it is in a structured format like the New York dataset.

Once the data is in a structured format, you can replicate the analysis that we did to the New York City dataset to explore and cluster the neighborhoods in the city of Toronto.

The  most  common  methods  for  synchronizing  networksproposed  in  the  literature  are,  open  loop  model  system  suchas filters, but these model system do not work correctly whenthe system is unbalanced in voltage source (Voltage)
